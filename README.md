In the article below it was demonstrated that a gaussian beam can be represented in ray optics by randomly distributed rays.

I changed the distribution and simulated as below:
two randolmy ditributed angles(alpha and theta) are able to describe a guassian beam.
theta is the angle between the beam direction and the incident plate. due to the article it has a normal distribution.
the added part is alpha: the angle between two transverse directions. which has a uniform distribution.
In addition to simulating 2D and 3D of guassian rays propagation, this program can find the appropriate size of iris so a specfic portion of beam power pass the hole.
